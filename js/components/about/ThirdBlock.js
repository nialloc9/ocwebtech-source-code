              I have always loved to make things. It is what I love to do.
              I love seeing an idea going from just that,
              an idea to something wonderful. Something we can stand back and be proud of.
              No industry offers us the chance to 'just build' like IT does.
              The tools are there and all we need to do is grab them and we can do anything.
