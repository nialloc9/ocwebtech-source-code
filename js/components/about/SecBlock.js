                I think the idea that anyone can do anything really inspires me. I believe that it does not matter where you are from or what you have done or hav not done, you can accomplish anything. Coding is a tool that we can harness to achieve the impossible.
                <br /><br />
                I think this really makes me believe not just I but everyone can do anything. Anything that we decide to do can become a reality if we decide that we are going to do it and we will not stop untill our dream is a reality. This really helps me stay motivated and helps me understand that it is not a case of "cannot" it is just needing to keep going and eventually the things we tought were impossible now come easy to us.
