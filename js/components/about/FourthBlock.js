                Travel. I really love to travel and to meet new people. I feel very fortunate to
                have met the awesome people I have while traveling from all over the world. I can
                remember when I was traveling in Vietnam I met a Dutch man who had been traveling
                for 2 years. He had been to so many Countries and had seen so many things and I
                can remember asking him what made him decide to leave home and travel for so long
                and he told me "Just because it's what he enjoyed doing and it was what he wanted to do".

                <br />
                <br />

                All these people who are living these amazing lives just because they found the thing that they loved to do. So, for me traveling isn't just about the places we see, it's also about the people we meet.

                I also love sport, especially team sports. I am a member of my local soccer team where we train and play together on  a weekly basis.
