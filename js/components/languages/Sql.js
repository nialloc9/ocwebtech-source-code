              <p>
                SQL or structured query language is used to communicate with a database. It is used to do things such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and
                DROP data from a database. Initially created in the 1970â€™s it is used the world over for managing databases. Queries and other SQL
                operations take the form of written statements using words such as INSERT AND CREATE.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each column in a database refers to a category of data and each row contains a data value for the intersecting column. For me, I have
                used SQL extensively for sites such as iGoalo.com to handle interactions with the database. An example of this is for handling the friendships and
                group members in iGoalo.
