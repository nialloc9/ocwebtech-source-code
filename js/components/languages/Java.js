                JAVA is an immensely powerful programming language that I love using. I would say it is the most important language I have learned because it taught me things such as OOP principles before I encountered them elsewhere. I love the way we can build anything in Java.

                For me, I have used Java to create things from hotel reservation systems to instant messengers and games. Some of these are available here on the portfolio page of OCWebTech while for others please feel free to check out my github page.
